## D-001 — Built on SaaS foundation; provider = org (2026-09-25)

**Chose:** clone `saas-foundation` v1.0.1 as its first clone. Each provider business is an org, so the PRD's `provider_id` is the `orgId`.
Clients are plain users with no org. A dual-role user is a client and also a member of their own provider org.

**Why:** auth (magic link + TOTP), the append-only audit log, cron, the injected clock and the mock payment provider are
already built and invariant-tested. Mapping provider to org reuses the foundation's not-found-on-foreign-row guard (`requireOrg`)
and the INV-01..04 harness, so neither is re-derived.

**Rejected:** a standalone app (it rebuilds solved auth and audit), and clone with a separate `Provider` table
(it carries unused org machinery alongside a second tenant key).

**Consequence:** the PRD asks for a scoping layer that *injects* the tenant filter. The template's convention is to
*spread* `inOrg(ctx)` by hand, so this clone adds a scoped client for provider-owned models (P0-1) and a lint test
against raw access. Client-side reads (search, a client's own bookings) are scoped by `clientId`. They are a
second axis, and they must not share the provider path (the PRD's dual-role bleed test).
